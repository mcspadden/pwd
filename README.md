# pwd
simple password generator written in python


# Prerequisites

You will need python 3 installed to run **pwd**. Open up a CLI terminal then type `python -v` to see the current version installed. Go [here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html "Python 3 documentation") for more information.

# Installing and Utilizing pwd
**Linux**
 * To install **pwd**, go to the main github page [here](https://github.com/mcspadden/pwd "pwd"). 
 * _Click_ **_Clone or Download_** > **_Download ZIP_**
 * _Navigate_ to the download location, _double-click_ the zip file to unzip it
 * Open up a **CLI terminal** > _Change_ the directory to the download location
   * **Example**: `cd /home/user/Downloads/pwd-Master`
 * Type the following commands:
  ```
  chmod +x pwd.py  
  python3 ./pwd.py
  ```
pwd is now successfully running. 
 
# Instructions

Once you start **pwd** and see `How many words you like the password to be? (1-30)`, type in a number between 1 and 30 then click _**Enter**_.
Type in `y` to make your password _all_ upper case or `n` to make your password _all_ lower case then click _**Enter**_. 

Your genererated password will now be printed. 

# Utilized Words
- The wordlist contains 1332 words.
- All words are between 4 and 7 letters long.
- No word in the list is a prefix of another word (e.g. watch, watcher).

# Entropy
Information regarding entropy can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory "Wikipedia: Entropy").  

You can calcuate your entropy [here](http://www.shannonentropy.netmark.pl/ "Shannon Entropy Calculator"). **DO NOT** generate a
password then go check your entropy _anywhere_ and continue utilizing that password. Generate a password with `x` number of words then
test the entropy. If you are satisfied, generate a new password with `x` the same as last time. 

# Post-quantum cryptography
These generated passwords will most likely not survice post-quantum cryptography. You can go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography "Wikipedia: Post-quantum cryptography") to read a bit more about it and I am looking at resolving this in v2.0.
